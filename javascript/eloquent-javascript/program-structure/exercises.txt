FizzBuzz:
    Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100,
    with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the
    number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.
    When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for
    numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz"
    for numbers divisible by only one of those).
    (This is actually an interview question that has been claimed to weed out
    a significant percentage of programmer candidates. So if you solved it, your
    labor market value just went up.)

ChessBoard:
    Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline
    characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space
    or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.
    Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:
     # # # #
    # # # #

     # # # #
    # # # #
