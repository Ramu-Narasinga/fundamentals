Bean counting:
    Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and returns
    a number that indicates how many uppercase “B” characters there are in the
    string.
    Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs, except
    it takes a second argument that indicates the character that is to be counted
    (rather than counting only uppercase “B” characters). Rewrite countBs to
    make use of this new function
